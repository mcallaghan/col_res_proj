@article{Efthymiou2012,
abstract = {The multi-characteristic synthesis of internet and social network users (different nationality, age, education level, interests) renders these platforms powerful tools, suitable for many purposes. Until now, businesses use them for marketing, political candidates for their election campaigns, information networks for news updates, companies for recruitment and, most recently, nations for revolutions. In this paper, the use of social networks for conducting transport surveys is presented. The integration with e-mail providers broadens their use and makes them more suitable for data collection. In addition, statistics regarding discussions (tweets) with words related to the survey's subject were extracted from Twitter and evaluated. Since the applications of social and other internet networks are always developed, their use for internet surveys should be further examined in the future.},

@article{Hughes2009,
abstract = {This paper offers a descriptive account of Twitter (a microblogging service) across four high-profile, mass convergence events – two emergency and two national security. We statistically examine how Twitter is being used surrounding these events, and compare and contrast how that behaviour is different from more general Twitter use. Our findings suggest that Twitter messages sent during these types of events contain more displays of information broadcasting and brokerage, and we observe that general Twitter use seems to have evolved over time to offer more of an information-sharing purpose. We also provide preliminary evidence that Twitter users who join during and in apparent relation to a mass convergence or emergency event are more likely to become long-term adopters of the technology.},

@article{Pak2010,
abstract = {Microblogging today has become a very popular communication tool among Internet users. Millions of users share opinions on different aspects of life everyday. Therefore microblogging web-sites are rich sources of data for opinion mining and sentiment analysis. Because microblogging has appeared relatively recently, there are a few research works that were devoted to this topic. In our paper, we focus on using Twitter, the most popular microblogging platform, for the task of sentiment analysis. We show how to automatically collect a corpus for sentiment analysis and opinionmining purposes. We performlinguistic analysis of the collected corpus and explain discovered phenomena. Using the corpus, we build a sentiment classifier, that is able to determine positive, negative and neutral sentiments for a document. Experimental evaluations show that our proposed techniques are efficient and performs better than previously proposed methods. In our research, we worked with English, however, the proposed technique can be used with any other language. 1.},

@article{Graham2014,
abstract = {The movements of ideas and content between locations and languages are unquestionably crucial concerns to researchers of the information age, and Twitter has emerged as a central, global platform on which hundreds of millions of people share knowledge and information. A variety of research has attempted to harvest locational and linguistic metadata from tweets in order to understand important questions related to the 300 million tweets that flow through the platform each day. However, much of this work is carried out with only limited understandings of how best to work with the spatial and linguistic contexts in which the information was produced. Furthermore, standard, well-accepted practices have yet to emerge. As such, this paper studies the reliability of key methods used to determine language and location of content in Twitter. It compares three automated language identification packages to Twitter’s user interface language setting and to a human coding of languages in order to identify common sources of disagreement. The paper also demonstrates that in many cases user-entered profile locations differ from the physical locations users are actually tweeting from. As such, these open-ended, user-generated, profile locations cannot be used as useful proxies for the physical locations from which information is published to Twitter.},
