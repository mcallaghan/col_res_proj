# Research Proposal for Max Callaghan and Valeria Nieberg

The body of twitter research has constantly grown over the past years; the platform has emerged as a valuable resource for tapping into the zeitgeist of the internet, its users, and often beyond.  [@Zimmer2014].
Sentiment in Twitter messages has even been
used by the financial industry to try to predict short-term performance of the stock
market (Bollen et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011) [@Zimmer2014]
Content analysis – where text within
a tweet was used in part of the analysis in some way – was a dominant form of
analysis (in all studied twitter study from 2007 to 2011), appearing in nearly two-thirds of all studies in the corpus. [@Zimmer2014]

Though the field of Sentiment Analysis (SA) is perhaps most developed in the business world (cite?), an increasing body of literature has developed, focused on retrieving information about political opinions from the Twittersphere. Tumasjan et. al's landmark paper, "Predicting Elections from Twitter: What 140 Characters Reveal about Political Sentiment", analysed the possibility of using twitter data to predict the 2009 German election [@tumasjan2010]. Though the results have come under scrutiny [see @jungherr2012pirate], the authors found that 

>Twitter is indeed used as a platform for political deliberation. The mere number of tweets reflects voter preferences and comes close to traditional election polls, while the sentiment of Twitter messages closely corresponds to political programs, candidate profiles, and evidence from the media coverage of the campaign trail.[@tumasjan2010, 183]

> NOTES
>  there already is a descriptive overview over twitter reaction to #aGreekment in the    twittersphere (LSE Blog, 5th of October)       http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/eurocrisispress/2015/10/06/agreekment-in-the-twittersphere/
> it looks at twitter as a platform for a europeanized public sphere
> if our focus is another, then their results could even help us. 
> do you think the following is something we could test, of course more elaborate? Eurocrisis has been going on for over 6 years now. In crisis situation, you would expect more engaged dialog. Over time, interest should decrease (at least for those not affected). Testing different points in time, we will see that this might be the case for some countries, for others not.
> caveat: "testing points in time" means testing peaks. how do peaks behave? it would be nice to compare non-peak times to peak times. (but see Hughes 2009, they research emergency vs. normal time twitter usage)
> could you propose a written hypothesis? because to be honest, i do not quite understand your consensus hypothesis yet and if you would want to work on it it would be nice if i understand it, and also consider it feasable!
> please max have a look at those tweets. do you think it is possible to somehow "alayze them", i am very pessimistic about it :(

## Data Sources
Two datasets are required for this project. The first is a corpus of tweets relating to the Greek debt crisis and the measures taken to manage the crisis by European institutions. The second is information about the users whose tweets form the body of that corpus.

Since late 2014, the whole corpus of twitter data has been searchable online [@wired_twitter]. Programmatic access to this archive is, however, more restricted. Twitter's public search API "is not complete index of all Tweets, but instead an index of recent Tweets. At the moment that index includes between 6-9 days of Tweets." [@twitter_search]. Twitter sells access to historical tweets through an API provided by its "enterprise API platform" GNIP [@twitter_full_archive]. This paper will adapt a publicly available program written in Java which scrapes results from Twitter's online search page [@GetOldTweets]. A list of queries involving combinations of keywords to do with the Greek debt crisis will be drawn up, and we will programmatically run through the list, using the GetOldTweets software to scrape the tweets returned by Twitter's comprehensive online search function that are given by each query.

We can use the R package 'TwitteR' [@R-twitteR] to retrieve more information about the unique users in our corpus dataset. The two datasets can then be merged so that tweets can be mapped by location.
