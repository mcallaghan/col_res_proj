# Research Proposal for M. Callaghan and V. Nieberg

## Introduction
context eurocrisis + timeline negotiations /memorandums

## Research Question

In our research project we will investigate the following questions:

What can twitter tell us about pan-European reactions to the European governance of the public-debt crisis in Greece? 
 
* What can variation across time and space in the volume of tweets regarding the euro crisis tell us about popular engagement with the issues?

* What can the content of tweets related to the crisis tell us about the spread of public opinion on the handling of the crisis in Greece between and within countries?

By investigating European public discourse on the Euro crisis the answer to these questions could potentially add to the literature on the emergence of a European public sphere.

## Literature Review

### On Twitter Research

The body of twitter research has constantly grown over the past years; the platform has emerged as a valuable resource for tapping into the zeitgeist of the internet, its users, and often beyond.  [@Zimmer2014].
Sentiment in Twitter messages has even been
used by the financial industry to try to predict short-term performance of the stock
market (Bollen et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011) [@Zimmer2014]
Content analysis – where text within
a tweet was used in part of the analysis in some way – was a dominant form of
analysis (in all studied twitter study from 2007 to 2011), appearing in nearly two-thirds of all studies in the corpus. [@Zimmer2014]

Twitter use in high-profile mass convergence events and catastrophes differs from more general twitter use. More broadcast-based information sharing activities happen during mass convergence and crisis events, where the user is pushing information out to many users and not directing it toward one specific user. The percentage of tweets containing URLs to be notably lower in the general sample than that of our convention and hurricane data samples. Also twitter usage followed different pattern in natural catastrophes and political top events. E.g. less URLs (information sharing) in politcal conventions than in natural catastrophes [@Hughes2009] 
 
There is something called "crisis informatics" - Huges cites Hagar, 2009; Hughes et al., 2008; Palen et al., 2009, which address social and technological concerns in emergency and crisis response. Might be worth looking into this.

Though the field of Sentiment Analysis (SA) is perhaps most developed in the business world (cite? Sentiment in Twitter messages has even been
used by the financial industry to try to predict short-term performance of the stock
market (Bollen et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011) [@Zimmer2014]), an increasing body of literature has developed, focused on retrieving information about political opinions from the Twittersphere. Tumasjan et. al's landmark paper, "Predicting Elections from Twitter: What 140 Characters Reveal about Political Sentiment", analysed the possibility of using twitter data to predict the 2009 German election [@tumasjan2010]. Though the results have come under scrutiny [see @jungherr2012pirate], the authors found that 
Sentiment analysis of
tweets was also a particularly prominent analysis type, with 16 percent of studies (conducted between 2007-2012)
relying on some form of classification or analysis of affect within tweets [@Zimmer2014, 253]


>Twitter is indeed used as a platform for political deliberation. The mere number of tweets reflects voter preferences and comes close to traditional election polls, while the sentiment of Twitter messages closely corresponds to political programs, candidate profiles, and evidence from the media coverage of the campaign trail.[@tumasjan2010, 183]



Devin Gaffney tests the degree to which geographic, semantic, and social distances impact
the frequency of interactions between users (uses information from geolocated tweets). [@Number2012]

There is research on ethical aspects of twitter research. concerns about creating a permanent archive of tweets have been voiced (whether such archive was aligned with users’ privacy expectations" have been (Zimmer quotes the following papers Vieweg, 2010; Zimmer,
2010) [@Zimmer2014]

### On Awareness and Public Opinion across Europe on the Governance of the Public-Debt Crisis in Greece

Academic research on the emergence of a European public sphere is not a recent phenomenon [@risse2003emerging, 1]. This research has been characterized as rather normative as the "research community has been [...] interested in producing policy recommendation for public sphere-building" [@Trenz2015, 234]. Hoever, recent studies seem to put emphasis on an empirical grounding of the debate [@Trenz2015, @Drewski2015]. This development is being mirrored in research on the public debate across Europe on the euro crisis. It has been suggested that “there  is  an  emerging  demos  in  the European  polity  and  it  has  been  strengthened during the euro crisis” [@risse2014, 1213]. Testing this hypothesis empirically by looking at newspaper editorials in Spain and Germany, Drewski found that there were significant differences  along  national  instead  of  ideological  lines  in  the discussion  of  the  Euro  crisis [@Drewski2015, 5]. <!-- Qoute from Drewski, maybe for the final paper? There is some evidence that Europeans have reacted to the crisis not by banding together,  but  by  rallying  around  national  values  and  interests.  For  example,  the  German center‐left was not ready to side with the Spanish center‐left to fight the neoliberal response to the crisis. Instead, they preferred to stick to their German compatriots from the center‐right in supporting austerity politics. This is no good news for the idealists’ vision of a European demos engendered by the Euro crisis. A post‐national European  democracy,  giving  voice  to  transnational  political  coalitions,  is  still  far from  becoming  reality -->

Max Hänska and Stefan Bauchowitz in a recent LSE blog entry track twitter activity during the negotiations leading up to the third Greek bailout agreement. [@LSEtwitter] According to their findings, tweets synchronised around key mini-events throughout the negotiations, with peaks and troughs mirrored across national twitter-spheres. These results suggest that popular engagement with the issue converges across Europe.

They further looked at instances of tweets containing #ThisIsACoup, representing a particular opinion on the agreement. The then showed that the spread of #ThisIsACoup was not reflected in the studied countries equally. This indicated a divergence of public opinion along national lines.

## Data Sources

This decrease in the research output and size of datasets analyzed is possibly
related to changes Twitter made to its API and terms of service in early 2011
(Melanson, 2011; Ramji, 2011) that limited researchers’ access to Twitter data and
effectively shut down popular services used by researchers to track and archive
Twitter activity, such as TwapperKeeper and 140kit (Watters, 2011; Sample, 2011). [@Zimmer2014, 257]

Two datasets are required for this project. The first is a corpus of tweets relating to the Greek debt crisis and the measures taken to manage the crisis by European institutions. The second is information about the users whose tweets form the body of that corpus.

Zimmer and Proferes identify the Library of Congress' decision to place every tweet since Twitter's inception in 2006 into an archive as validating "the research importance of twitter" [@Zimmer2014,251]. Despite this announcement occuring in 2010, five years later, the archive is still not open to researchers [@politico].


Since late 2014, the whole corpus of twitter data has been searchable online [@wired_twitter]. Programmatic access to this archive is, however, more restricted. Twitter's public search API "is not complete index of all Tweets, but instead an index of recent Tweets. At the moment that index includes between 6-9 days of Tweets." [@twitter_search]. Twitter sells access to historical tweets through an API provided by its "enterprise API platform" GNIP [@twitter_full_archive]. This paper will adapt a publicly available program written in Java which scrapes results from Twitter's online search page [@GetOldTweets]. A list of queries involving combinations of keywords to do with the Greek debt crisis will be drawn up, and we will programmatically run through the list, using the GetOldTweets software to scrape the tweets returned by Twitter's comprehensive online search function that are given by each query.

We can use the R package 'TwitteR' [@R-twitteR] to retrieve more information about the unique users in our corpus dataset. The two datasets can then be merged so that tweets can be mapped by location.
