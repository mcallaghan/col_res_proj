# Research Proposal for Max Callaghan and Valeria Nieberg

Body of twitter research has constantly grown over the past years; the platform has emerged as a valuable resource for tapping into the zeitgeist of the internet, its users, and often beyond.  [@Zimmer2014].
Sentiment in Twitter messages has even been
used by the financial industry to try to predict short-term performance of the stock
market (Bollen et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011) [@Zimmer2014]
Content analysis – where text within
a tweet was used in part of the analysis in some way – was a dominant form of
analysis (in all studied twitter study from 2007 to 2011), appearing in nearly two-thirds of all studies in the corpus. [@Zimmer2014]

Twitter use in high-profile mass convergence events and catastrophes differs from more general twitter use. More broadcast-based information sharing activities happen during mass convergence and crisis events, where the user is pushing information out to many users and not directing it toward one specific user. The percentage of tweets containing URLs to be notably lower in the general sample than that of our convention and hurricane data samples. Also twitter usage followed different pattern in natural catastrophes and political top events. E.g. less URLs (information sharing) in politcal conventions than in natural catastrophes [@Hughes2009] 
 
There is something called "crisis informatics" - Huges cites Hagar, 2009; Hughes et al., 2008; Palen et al., 2009, which address social and technological concerns in emergency and crisis response. Might be worth looking into this.

Devin Gaffney tests the degree to which geographic, semantic, and social distances impact
the frequency of interactions between users (uses information from geolocated tweets). [@Number2012]


> NOTES
>  there already is a descriptive overview over twitter reaction to #aGreekment in the    twittersphere (LSE Blog, 5th of October)       http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/eurocrisispress/2015/10/06/agreekment-in-the-twittersphere/
> it looks at twitter as a platform for a europeanized public sphere
> if our focus is another, then their results could even help us. 
> do you think the following is something we could test, of course more elaborate? Eurocrisis has been going on for over 6 years now. In crisis situation, you would expect more engaged dialog. Over time, interest should decrease (at least for those not affected). Testing different points in time, we will see that this might be the case for some countries, for others not.
> caveat: "testing points in time" means testing peaks. how do peaks behave? it would be nice to compare non-peak times to peak times. (but see Hughes 2009, they research emergency vs. normal time twitter usage)
> could you propose a written hypothesis? because to be honest, i do not quite understand your consensus hypothesis yet and if you would want to work on it it would be nice if i understand it, and also consider it feasable!
> please max have a look at those tweets. do you think it is possible to somehow "alayze them", i am very pessimistic about it :(
